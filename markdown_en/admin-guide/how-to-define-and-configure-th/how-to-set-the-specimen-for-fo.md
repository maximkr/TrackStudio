# How to set the specimen for formatting of Task

Sometimes while creating a task, you may need that its description is written in a particular format, has some specific points, and is formatted as per the requirements. You can use templates of categories for this purpose. Template is a common HTML-document, created in the inbuilt editor in the same way as general description of the task is set.

So as to set the template for a particular category, go to the page of this category, and then — to the tab "**Category Template**". Thereafter, when you are finished with the formatting of template in the editor, press the button **"Save"**.
