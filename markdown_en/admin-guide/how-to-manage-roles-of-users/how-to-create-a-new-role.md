When the role is created, the permissions, inherited from the basic role of creator, are displayed. That is, if e.g. your role is prohibited from viewing the links to SCM, then it will also be prohibited for all the roles which you will be creating. However, you can thereafter permit these actions for the created roles.

## How to delete role from the system

Unused role can be deleted from the system. For this purpose, you need to:

- In the menu, go to the users management
- In the menu, go to the page “**Roles**”
- Check one or more roles, which need to be deleted
- Press the button “**Delete**”

## How to copy a role

You can copy any of the roles created by you or your subordinates. When the roles are copied, all the properties of the role, permissions for it in categories and workflows, and permissions for executing the actions and access to the fields get completely cloned. But **access control rules to projects are not copied**. For the purpose of cloning the role:

- In the menu go to the users management
- In the menu go to the page “**Roles**”
- Check one or more roles, which need to be copied
- Press the button “**Clone**”
