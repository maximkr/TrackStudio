# How to Create New User

These actions can be performed by system administrators and managers, though there is a hierarchy of colleagues and one can add or delete only subordinate users. So as to add a new user, go to the menu item **Users Management »Users List**** **. In the tool bar of quick access, press the button for adding the user with the required role (you may also notice the menu **Other Actions**** **in the toolbar).

Fill the form. You may right away set the password for this user. The user can change the password after he signs in. If you indicate this as **default project**, the user gets access to this project.
