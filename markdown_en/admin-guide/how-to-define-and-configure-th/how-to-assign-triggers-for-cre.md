# How to assign triggers for creating and editing the tasks

Through category, you can assign triggers which will be executed while creating or editing the task. Triggers can be of three types: first types of triggers are executed before basic operations (immediately before creation of task), second ones are executed in place of basic operation and third ones – after the execution of operation. This way, for one operation you can’t assign more than three triggers. Triggers have been explained in detail in the respective [documentation section](../../developer-guide/index.md).

So as to assign the trigger to a category, go to the page of this category through menu, thereafter — to the tab “**Triggers**.”

If triggers of a particular type are available in the system, they will be displayed for selection. If there are no triggers of this type, selection field doesn’t appear.

After selecting the required triggers, press the button “**Save**”.
