# How to Filter the Tasks

So as to streamline the tasks in the list and sort out the unnecessary ones, you and your users require a set of predefined filters for tasks. Filter for tasks can be created using several methods. Generally, one may go to the page of filters through the menu item **Tasks Management » Filters List**** **. You will notice that the filters are connected to the project and apply to the sub-tasks of the project downwards in the hierarchy. This means that the filters, created for the root task, will be visible in all the projects of TrackStudio.
