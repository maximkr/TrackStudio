# How to Copy a Category

You can “clone” one or several of the selected categories. While cloning, new categories are created that are completely identical to the ones being cloned: image settings, relations between categories, access control rule settings, settings of triggers and templates, are retained.

So as to clone the category, through the menu go to the list of categories, mark the required category and press the button “**Clone**”.
