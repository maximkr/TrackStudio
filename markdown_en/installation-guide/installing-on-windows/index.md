# Installing on Windows

We are releasing TrackStudio Enterprise in two versions: Standalone - for servers with graphical user interface and WAR - for servers without a graphical environment.

**The Standalone** release comes with a utility **Server Manager**, helping to configure and run TrackStudio. The bundle also includes an application server **jetty**, the email server **jes** and DBMS **Hypersonic SQL**. This bundle actually works out of the box, so you can start the installation immediately TrackStudio without adjustment to become familiar with the system.

Also, **Server Manager** helps you to export and import data from the database. (In TrackStudio 4.0.10 you can also use a console utility **dbtool**.)

At the trial stage of we recommend using a Standalone version.

**WAR** version is made to run under Tomcat application server. It contains non-compiled JSP. This version configures by editing **properties** files. You can also copy pre-configured properties files from **Server Manager** from another machine.
