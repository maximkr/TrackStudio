# Time Tracking in TrackStudio

Using TrackStudio, you can track the time, spent on solving the task, and the working time of your subordinates.

TrackStudio doesn’t track the activity of users and doesn’t take the screenshots. Users themselves calculate the time spent on solving the task and enter it while executing the next operation at the task. For example,

- The user updates the task and wants to reflect this in the system. Thus he executes the operation “resolve”, changes the assignee to tester, adds the notes and enters the time spent on the task (e.g. 1 hour 20 minutes).

This all is executed on the same form. For simplifying the calculation of time in each task, TrackStudio for each user can initiate the individual timer. It calculates the time from the moment the page gets loaded, and is very convenient for small tasks, typical to Service Desk: registration of incidents, customer support, and answering the telephone calls etc.

- Tester tests, adds the message of type “verify” and mentions his time (e.g. 40 minutes).
- Manager views the task and can see the time, mentioned in the operations by each developer, total time of all the developers in the properties of the task.
- Manager, or other user, can see, how much time has been spent on the project, in the properties of the project: total time for all the sub-tasks of the project are displayed there. For project, [another format for display of time](http://www.trackstudio.com/how-configure-properties-task-particular-category.html)[ ](http://www.trackstudio.com/how-configure-properties-task-particular-category.html)can be selected, e.g., in days and months.
- Similarly, diversified statistics are available: e.g., “how much time has been spent by the developers on high-priority tasks during the last week”, “which project took the maximum time during the last year”, “how much time was spent on testing of tasks”) — a [report can be made](http://www.trackstudio.ru/howto-make-reports-trackstudio.html)[ ](http://www.trackstudio.ru/howto-make-reports-trackstudio.html)and the information can be obtained in any format : CSV,HTML,PDF, XML with XSL-conversion etc. There is a provision for export to MS Project also. You can see that the time of all the developers is not summed-up in one field, but one can calculate the time for each person and each operation (verify/close/resolve/etc).
- Using subscription, one may get periodic statistics through email; e.g., list of hours entered by the users can be received daily at 1800 hrs.
- For each task or project, the manager can set “**the budget**”, and thereafter search the tasks (or obtain particular notification), or the budget is exceeded.
- For each user, it is possible to specify for which projects he can view or edit the entered time, and for which he can’t.
