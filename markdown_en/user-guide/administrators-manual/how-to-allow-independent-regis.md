# How to Allow Independent Registration of Users

If you want that the external users could take part in your project or track it, you will need to define the registration rules for them governing their registration and entry into the project.

Go to your project and then to the menu item **Task Management » Registration Rules**** **. On the next page press the button **Create Registration Rule**. Give the name to the rule and select the role to be used by new users during registration.
