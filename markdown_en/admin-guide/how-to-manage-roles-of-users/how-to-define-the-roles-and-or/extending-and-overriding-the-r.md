# Extending and Overriding the Roles

There can be times when a developer in the project needs to perform the role of tester also. This requires the user permissions to be extended. In this case the user must be once again added in the access control rules, and then the group needs to be edited in one of the entries:

If user is simply added in the access permissions and assigned another role, he will have two roles: his own (corresponding to his user account) and the overridden one.

For the purpose of assigning him only one role i.e. of tester, option **Override** must be selected.

Same principle works for access control rules, defined at different levels: the role, set at higher level, can be overridden at the lower level.
